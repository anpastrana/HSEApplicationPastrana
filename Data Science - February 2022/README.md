# Why Aren't They Getting Vaccinated? Correlation of Demographic Factors with Vaccination Rates in the USA.
# Data Science Project

### A. Project Description
The project’s title is “Why Aren't They Getting Vaccinated? Correlation of Demographic Factors with Vaccination Rates in the USA.” It was completed as part of the requirements for the course DATA100 (Principles of Data Science). This was a data science project employing exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis in order to determine the relationship of demographic traits (ethnicity, religiosity, age, and political leaning) of states in the United States of America and COVID-19 vaccination rates. 

State data from 2014, 2017, and 2019 was obtained from Our World in Data, Statista, and the Kaiser Family Foundation. This data was wrangled and cleaned into workable datasets via Python. Summative statistics and Pearson’s R were used as the primary methodology for the project, and were executed via Python in JupyterLab.

Findings indicate that higher concentrations of republicanism, religiosity, and older age were significantly correlated with lower vaccination rates within a state, ceteris paribus. The study recommends personalizing the promotion of the COVID-19 vaccine, working within institutions trusted by the demographics less likely to opt into a vaccine and making use of monetary incentives to work around persistent mistrust of the health sector. The project also recommends expanding the study further via OLS Regression.

### B. Running Requirements
To run the notebook found in the GitHub link, it is necessary that Python and the following Python packages are installed:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3.Matplotlib
4. Scipy
5. Seaborn
<br>
After Python and the above packages have been installed, please run the notebook via JupyterLab.

### D. Precise Contribution of Applicant Arianne N. Pastrana
I was personally responsible for the following aspects of the project:
Obtained the datasets from the given online databases;
Worked in tandem with Hans Wong to wrangle the datasets into a single working dataset for statistical treatment;
Coded  all statistical treatment under the section III: Descriptive Statistics, including visualizations via graphs and tables;
Coded all statistical treatment under the section IV: Pearson’s R, as well as interpreting the data, justifying use of Pearson’s R, and stating the a-priori expectations and hypothesis.
