# HSEApplicationPastrana
This repository was created by myself, Arianne N. Pastrana, and contains Data Science Projects implemented over the course of my Minor in Data Science. This repository is a collection of notable student projects, acting as part of a collection for my application to the Master's in Data Science of the Higher School of Economics.
