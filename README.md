# Master's in Data Science Application
### Collection of Notable Data Science Projects
### Repository made by Arianne N. Pastrana

<hr>

This repository was created by myself, Arianne N. Pastrana, and contains Data Science Projects implemented over the course of my Minor in Data Science. This repository is a collection of notable student projects, acting as part of a collection for my application to the Master's in Data Science of the Higher School of Economics. This repository is a supplement to the PDF versions of the Python notebooks submitted in the application, such that the admissions committee may peruse the actual code.

All notebooks were made through Anaconda Navigator on JupyterLab, using Python.

Given the nature of the curriculum in the Minor in Data Science of De La Salle University Manila, all data science projects were made in groups. My precise contribution to each data science project is noted in the README files of each subfolder.
